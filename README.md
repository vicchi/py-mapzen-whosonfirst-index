# py-mapzen-whosonfirst-index

Python tools for indexing Who's On First documents.

## Install

```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt .
```

## IMPORTANT

This library is provided as-is, right now. It lacks proper
documentation which will probably make it hard for you to use unless
you are willing to poke and around and investigate things on your
own.
